# Learning objectives  
The learning objectives for this exercise are to:  
  - Learn where to find crop-specific nutrient recommendations  
  - Understand what information is needed to recommend N in cotton   
  - Estimate zone-specific cotton yield potential  
  - Calculate zone-specific total N recommendation 
  - Calculate zone-specific side-dress variable N rate recommendation  
  - Calculate total amount of fertilizer to order  
  - Export recommendation to file to be used in a variable rate controller  

# Introduction  
We are going to create a recommendation to apply variable rate nitrogen (N) fertilizer in cotton, with a different in-season side-dress rate for each zone.    

> How do we know how much N cotton needs (or really, how do we know how much of any given nutrient any crop needs)?  

A few sources of this type of information would be **research papers** and **extension publications**.  

Normally (in the US, at least), crop-specific nutrient recommendations are available through extension publications.

A quick Google search on **"cotton nutrient recommendation in Georgia"** (notice the specificity of crop and state in the key words, important as each state would have their own recommendation algorithm for a given crop) returns a few results.

For Georgia, UGA publishes annually the **"Cotton Production Guide"**, which contains not only nutrient but all sorts of management recommendations for cotton. The UGA 2022 Cotton production guide can be found [here](https://secure.caes.uga.edu/extension/publications/files/pdf/AP%20124-2_1.PDF).

Pages 9 and 10 of the guide have information on N in cotton, including a table relating yield potential with N rate.  

This is the same information as what we saw with Dr. Virk on the tool [UGAFertEx](https://aesl.ces.uga.edu/calculators/ugfertex/).  


From that table and accompanying text on the guide, we can see that cotton total N rate:  
- Depends on **yield potential**  
- Should be **adjusted in +25%** in certain cases (e.g., cotton following cotton)    
- Should be **split-applied**  

> So, what are the required pieces of information that we need to know in order to make a recommendation of N in cotton?  

1.  
2.  
3.  

> How can we define yield potential for each of the zones?

        legend.text = element_text(size=12))

```


```{r yieldic17}

```{r zone_st}
zone_st <- read_sf("../data/zone_st.geojson") %>%
  dplyr::select(zone, geometry)

zone_st
```

# Wrangling  
```{r Merging yield and zones}
zone_yield <- zone_st %>%
  st_join(yieldic17,
          join = st_equals, 
          left = T
  ) %>%
  st_join(yieldic19,
          join = st_equals, 
          left = T
  ) %>%
  st_join(yieldic20,
          join = st_equals, 
          left = T
  )

```

# VRN  
Below, we will
- Calculate zone-specific yield potential (as the mean of 3 years)    
- Calculate the total N rate (lbs N/ac) needed with the algorithm for N in cotton from the production guide
- Adjust it in +25% assuming that we are following cotton  
- Adjust it in 2/3 to be applied side-dress (1/3 applied at planting)  
- Define our N source as urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) 28% N  
- Calculate the total product rate (gal UAN/ac)  


```{r vrn calculation }
vrn 

vrn
```
UAN is a liquid solution, so how do we go from volume of solution to lbs of N?  

> What information do we need?  










We can find this information on the fertilizer label/msds information from manufacturer.  

Normally, UAN 28% density is 10.67 lbs/gal, as we can find from these retailers:  
- https://www.agricocanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/agric-101-SDS_Urea-Ammonium-Nitrate-UAN-Solution.pdf  
-  https://www.cfindustries.com/globalassets/cf-industries/media/documents/safety-data-sheets/uan---north-america/urea_ammonium_nitrate_solution_uan_sds.pdf  

NOTE: UAN is normally sold as 28, 30, or 32%N. Each of them has a different density!  


```{r UAN volume to mass of N}
uan28density_lbsgal 

uan28Nconc_pct 

uan28_lbsNgal 

uan28_lbsNgal 

```

How much UAN28% do we need to have delivered at the field to ensure enough product for application?  

```{r total volume of UAN per area}
vrn 

```

# Rx map  
```{r vrn vector}
vrn_v 

```

```{r vrn plot}
vrn_v %>%
  mutate(uanrate_galac=factor(uanrate_galac)) %>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_sf(aes(fill=...,
              color=...))+
  labs(title="VRN Rx - UAN 28% rate",
       fill="UAN rate\n(gal/ac)",
       color="UAN rate\n(gal/ac)")+
  mytheme_map


ggsave("../output/VRN.png",
      width = 4, 
       height = 4
       )  

```

# Exporting  
We are going to export as **shapefile** as it is the most commonly accepted format in variable rate controllers.  

Since we are exporting as shapefile, let's create a sub-folder inside `output` called `VRN` to have all the associated files saved together.  

```{r exporting}
vrn_v %>%
  ...

```

# Summary  
In summary, today we:  
- Understood where to look for information on crop and nutrient-specific recommendations  
- Defined yield potential for each zone  
- Calculated VRN in both lbs N/ac and gallons UAN38/ac  
- Exported VRN Rx as a shapefile  

Next, we will wrap up and perform a profitability analysis.
