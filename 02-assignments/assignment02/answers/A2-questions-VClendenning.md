# Assignment #2  
## Instructions  
In class, we wrangled and cleaned yield monitor data from a field in 2017.  

Now, you are asked to perform the same wrangling and cleaning steps on yield monitor data from the same field but collected in 2019 and 2020.  

These data sets need to be downloaded from the course GitHub page. They are located in the `03-data` as csv files.  

As part of the assignment, you will need to:  
- Wrangle and clean each of the two data sets  
- Provide me with a statistical summary of the cleaned version (including min, mean, median, max, sd, cv) to be included in the answers portion of this document (below).    
- Export the cleaned version to file (save it to the `data` folder of your personal project)    

Some tips:  
- You can copy and paste this script twice, renaming each of the copies to something like "yield-editor-2019.Rmd".  

- Use each of the script copies to adapt for each of the new data sets.  

- The Dry_Yield and Speed columns are not named the same in these two new data sets, you will need to accommodate this in your code.  

- Deadline is Thursday 11:59 pm (we will use all 3 cleaned yield data on our next steps on Friday). 

## Questions  

1. What is the min, mean, max, and cv for the **cleaned** yield data from 2019?  

min: 31.6558 max: 3328.61 mean: 1657.513 cv: 38.14657
