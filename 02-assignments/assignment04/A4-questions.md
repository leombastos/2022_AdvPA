# Assignment #4 - Focal filter  
In class, we have used a focal filter to smooth out the zones assignment for our field.  

Now, you are asked to play around with the focal filter arguments of matrix size and function type, and answer questions based on the results.  

## Instructions  
1. Go back to the focal window chunk and play with it by testing the following combinations:  
- matrix 3 x 3, smooth function of mean  
- matrix 3 x 3, smooth function of minimum  
- matrix 3 x 3, smooth function of max  

For each of these three new scenarios, create a map with the result making sure the map title (tip: in function `labs()`) reflects the matrix size and function type, and export this plot to your "output" folder in a .png format, following the name scheme of zonesmoothed_matrixsize_function (e.g., zonesmoothed_5x5_mean.png for the settings using during class). 

2. Copy into a word file the zone maps:  
- Before smoothing (done in class)  
- Matrix 5 x 5, smooth function of mean (done in class)
- Each of the three scenarios ran above  

After pasting all maps on word, resize each of them to be 1.56 inch height x 1.17 inch width (so you can see all of them in one row). After this step, answer the following questions:  

3. Describe what happened visually on the map when you changed the matrix size from 5x5 to 3x3 while using the same function (i.e., mean). 

4. Describe what happened visually on the map when you changed the function from mean to min, and from mean to max with the matrix size of 3x3.   

5. Among all the four focal filters we tried, which one would you recommend to be used for this field? Why?

After answering all questions, send me the word file with all 5 maps and answers to questions 3 to 5. Include your initials on the word file name (e.g., A4-questions-LMB.docx) and send to **lmbastos@uga.edu** by **Wednesday, April 27th 11:59 pm**.
