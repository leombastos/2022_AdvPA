# Spatial stability  
Every time we deal with yield data across various years/fields/crops, there are challenges:  
- If different years/fields/crops, how to compare?  
- Even if same field but different years/crops, how to compare?  

Some solutions:  
- Standardize by mean/median/max (numerical). Ex. field mean in a given year was 1500 lb/ac, so divide all other yield values from that year by 1500.  

- Standardize by quantile (categorical). Ex. field median (e.g., 50% quantile) was 2000 lb/ac, so all observations below 2000 are classified as "low", and all above 2000 are classified as "high" for that year.  

**In our case, we are using the quantile approach.**
First let's calculate median yield per year, and then classify all yield observations as lower than the median (low) or higher than the median (high).  

Beginning with 2017 yield data.
```{r s_17}
s_17 <- yieldic17 %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "id") %>%
  mutate(medianyield_lbac=median(ipyield_lbac)) %>%
  mutate(snyield=case_when(
    ipyield_lbac >= medianyield_lbac ~ "high",
    ipyield_lbac < medianyield_lbac ~ "low"
  )) %>%
  dplyr::select(id, ipyield_lbac, snyield_17=snyield, geometry)

s_17
```
Let's check how does this classification look like in space.  
```{r s_17 map}
s_17_map <- ggplot()+
  geom_sf(data = s_17,
          aes(fill=snyield_17), color=NA)+
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option="E")+
  labs(title="2017")+
  theme_map()+
  theme(legend.position = "right")


s_17_map 
```
Repeat the same steps for 2019.  
```{r s_19}
s_19 <- yieldic19 %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "id") %>%
  mutate(medianyield_lbac=median(ipyield_lbac)) %>%
  mutate(snyield=case_when(
    ipyield_lbac >= medianyield_lbac ~ "high",
    ipyield_lbac < medianyield_lbac ~ "low"
  )) %>%
  dplyr::select(id, snyield_19=snyield, geometry) 

s_19
```

```{r s_19 map}
s_19_map <- ggplot()+
  geom_sf(data = s_19,
          aes(fill=snyield_19), color=NA)+
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option="E")+
    labs(title="2019")+
  theme_map()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")


s_19_map 
```
Repeat the same steps for 2020.  
```{r s_20}
s_20 <- yieldic20 %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "id") %>%
  mutate(medianyield_lbac=median(ipyield_lbac)) %>%
  mutate(snyield=case_when(
    ipyield_lbac >= medianyield_lbac ~ "high",
    ipyield_lbac < medianyield_lbac ~ "low"
  )) %>%
  dplyr::select(id, snyield_20=snyield, geometry) 

s_20
```

```{r s_20 map}
s_20_map <- ggplot()+
  geom_sf(data = s_20,
          aes(fill=snyield_20), color=NA)+
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option="E")+
  labs(title="2020")+
  theme_map()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")

s_20_map 
```
Let's plot all 3 maps side-by-side to assist in visualizing them.  
```{r all maps}
library(patchwork)
s_17_map + s_19_map + s_20_map +
  plot_layout(guides = "collect")

```



# Spatio-temporal stability  
To perform a temporal analysis, we need to merge all three data frames into one.  

After joining the data sets, we still only have their information on year-specific spatial classification (low and high yielding). 

> How can we merge these pieces of information to create a spatial-temporal classification?  

Here's how I want to classify our spatial-temporal classes:  
- If a pixel was low yielding in all 3 years, then it gets classified as stable low (sl)  

- If a pixel was high yielding in all 3 years, then it gets classified as stable high (sh)  

- Otherwise, then it gest classified as unstable (uns).  


```{r st_all}
st_all <- s_17 %>%
  left_join(s_19 %>%
              as.data.frame() %>%
              dplyr::select(-geometry)) %>%
  left_join(s_20 %>%
              as.data.frame() %>%
              dplyr::select(-geometry)) %>%
  
  mutate(stnyield=case_when(
    snyield_17 == snyield_19 & 
      snyield_17 == snyield_20 & 
      snyield_17 == "low" ~ "sl",
    
    snyield_17 == snyield_19 & 
      snyield_17 == snyield_20 & 
      snyield_17 == "high" ~ "sh",
    
    T ~ "uns"
  ))

st_all
```
```{r st_all_map}
ggplot()+
  geom_sf(data = st_all,
          aes(fill=stnyield), color=NA)+
    scale_fill_viridis_d(option="C")+
  theme_map()

```
> Just eyeballing, what proportion of this field do you think is unstable? 20%? 50%?  






Let's calculate below:  
```{r proportion per stability zone}
st_all %>%
  group_by(stnyield) %>%
  tally() %>%
  mutate(prop=(n/4032)*100)

```
Imagine this is your farm, and I tell you that in about 43% of your field, yield can be among highest or lowest just depending on the year.  

> How would you manage it?  


# Exporting  
Let's export this data set so we can use it again in a future exercise.  
```{r exporting yield stability}
write_sf(st_all, 
         "../data/st_all.geojson")
```

# Summary  

Today we:  
- Imported all three interpolated cleaned yield data  
- Classified each year-specific yield pixel as low vs. high (spatial stability)  
- Joined the three data sets, and classified each pixel as stable high, stable low, or unstable (spatial-temporal stability)  
- Exported the spatial-temporal stability layer
