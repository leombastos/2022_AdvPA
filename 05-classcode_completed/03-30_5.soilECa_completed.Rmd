# Learning Objectives  

Today, our objectives are to:  
- Discuss about apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa), what it is, how it is measured, and why it is an important layer in precision ag  

- Import point vector data of soil ECa  
- Interpolate soil ECa point data for two depths   
- Export soil ECa layers to file  

# Soil ECa  
## What is electrical conductivity (EC)?  
Soil sample is collected on the field, brought to a laboratory, saturated with water, and its extractant measured for electrical conductivity (EC) between two electrodes.  

Time-consuming and labor-intensive, not feasible for PA applications.

## What is bulk soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa)?  
Bulk soil apparent electrical conductivity measures EC of bulk soil (liquid and solid phases).  
```{r @ bulk soil eca}
knitr::include_graphics("https://agronomy.netlify.app/img/soileca/eca.png")

```

No need for sample collection, measures in-situ.  

## How is soil ECa measured?  
Three methods exist to measure bulk soil ECa:  
- Electrical resistivity
```{r @ ER - Veris 3100 }
knitr::include_graphics("https://agronomy.netlify.app/img/soileca/ER.png")

```


- Electromagnetic induction  
```{r @ EM - Geonics EM38}
knitr::include_graphics("https://agronomy.netlify.app/img/soileca/EM.png")
```


- Time-domain reflectometry (TDR)  
```{r TDR }
knitr::include_graphics("https://agronomy.netlify.app/img/soileca/tdr.png")

```


## What affects soil ECa?  
- Soil salinity:  
```{r soil eca vs salinity}
knitr::include_graphics("https://agronomy.netlify.app/img/soileca/ecavssalt.png")
```

- Soil texture:  
```{r @ soil eca vs texture}
knitr::include_graphics("https://agronomy.netlify.app/img/soileca/ecavstexture.png")

```

- Soil water content  
```{r soil eca vs. swc}
knitr::include_graphics("https://agronomy.netlify.app/img/soileca/ecavswater.png")

```

Others:  
- Soil temperature  
- Soil organic matter content  
- Soil bulk density  


## Why is it important in PA?  
When soil ECa is mostly controlled by texture, it can be used to create texture-based zones.  

This is important in PA because texture is normally correlated with other yield limiting factors like water availability, cation exchange capacity, and nutrient availability.  

```{r soil eca vs yield}

```
# Wrangling  
```{r eca_w}
eca_w <- eca %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  dplyr::select(x=f1,
                y=f2,
                eca30_dsm=f3,
                eca90_dsm=f4)  %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("x", "y")) %>%
  st_set_crs(value = 4326) %>%
  st_transform(crs = 6345)

eca_w 
```

# EDA  
```{r eca30 plot}
eca_w %>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_sf(aes(color=eca30_dsm),
          size=.5)+
  scale_color_viridis_b()+
  mytheme_map

```


```{r eca90 plot}
eca_w %>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_sf(aes(color=eca90_dsm),
          size=.5)+
  scale_color_viridis_b()+
  mytheme_map

```

# Grid  
Since we are interpolating, we need to create a grid (same as for the yield exercise) based on the field boundary.    

```{r boundary_w}
boundary_w <- read_sf("../data/KB_boundary.geojson") %>%
  st_transform(crs = 6345)

boundary_w
```

```{r grid_r}
# grid in vector format
grid_r <-  boundary_w %>%
  st_make_grid(cellsize = 10) %>%
  st_as_sf() %>%
  st_rasterize(dx=10, dy=10) %>%
  st_crop(boundary_w)

grid_r

ggplot()+
  geom_stars(data = grid_r)+
  mytheme_map

```

# Interpolation
## eca30  
```{r eca30_idw_mod}
eca30_idw_mod <- gstat(formula = eca30_dsm ~ 1,  
                       data = eca_w)

eca30_idw_mod
```

```{r eca30_idw_pred}

  scale_fill_viridis_b()+
  geom_sf(data=boundary_w, fill=NA)+
  labs(fill="ECa\n0-30 cm\n(dS/m)")+
  mytheme_map

eca30_map
```

## eca90  
```{r eca90_idw_mod}

                       data = eca_w)

  geom_stars(data = eca90_idw_pred)+

## Plotting all together
```{r plotting all together}

ggsave("../output/soileca.png", width = 6, height = 3)
```

# Grid extraction  
```{r eca30_v}
eca30_v <- eca30_idw_pred %>%
  st_as_sf(as_points = F, 
           merge = F) %>%
  dplyr::select(eca30_dsm=var1.pred) 

eca30_v
```


```{r eca90_v}
eca90_v <- eca90_idw_pred %>%
  st_as_sf(as_points = F, 
           merge = F) %>%
  dplyr::select(eca90_dsm=var1.pred) 

eca90_v
```

# Merging eca layers  
```{r eca_v }
eca_v <- eca30_v %>%
  st_join(eca90_v, 
          join = st_equals, 
          left = T) 

eca_v
```

# Exporting  
Exporting to file to use later for management zone creation.  
```{r exporting}
write_sf(eca_v, "../data/eca_v.geojson",
         delete_dsn = T)
```

# Summary  
Today we have:  
- Imported point vector soil ECa data  
- Interpolated soil ECa at two different depths to same grid as used for yield (keeping them all on same spatial extent and resolution)  
- Transformed them into vector, joined both depths in one object, and exported to file  

# What's next?  
Next we will be ready to create and validate management zones!

For that, we will first load all layers created until now together.

Then, we will check their relationships, run a tree algorithm to explore variable importance (more on that later), and finally use a clustering algorithm to create zones.
